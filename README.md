### MapTP
* Teleports you to a location on the map by simply double clicking!

* Freezes a user in place, being unable to move. Resolves hack clients as position is cached and any changes will be set back to the original freeze location. Works over IP and across sessions.

### CustomMessages
* Introduces the ability to add custom commands with in-chat responses. Potential use for this plugin is in commands like `/discord` and `/vote`.

### BuildMode
* Creates a custom time for each user so it always stays day, and removes cavern backgrounds. Overwrites the TShock time command & introduces customizable buffs while in buildmode.

### FindPermission
* Finds permissions based on the command they're used by.

* Adds quick kick responses by specifying keywords. Gives the ability to kick offending users in quicker fashion. Keywords are available at source readme.
