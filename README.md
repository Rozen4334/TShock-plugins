# TShock-plugins
A collection of all my public plugins, including source, documentation & releases! 

#### ⚠️ No plugins present here lead to direct download links. 
The 💾 `.. v1.0` tag only leads to the release page on the plugin repository itself.

#### ⚠️ Do not download random 'plugins' from the internet!
While many like me have no malicious intent, downloading dll's from the internet can seriously harm your device. Do not do this if you do not trust the owner or source of the download!
